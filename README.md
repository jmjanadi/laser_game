# Laser Game (in progress)

## Introduction
This project consists of the design for a game in which the user attempts to reach a destination as quickly as possible while avoiding detection by lasers. The project is developed in the C programming language on ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers. The code consists of firmware that operates an LCD and US sensors. It also makes use of the Bluetooth Low Energy communication protocol to establish wireless connections between the multiple MCUs.
